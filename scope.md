# Meta Ad Creator - Project Scope

## Project Overview
An agentic system that uses two AI agents to create Meta ad creatives from product images and descriptions.

## System Architecture
- **Input**: Product image + description
- **Agent 1**: Image + description → Structured prompt (for Google Nano Banana model)
- **Human Review**: Review Agent 1 output before proceeding
- **Agent 2**: Image + prompt → Meta ad creative (image with overlaid text)
- **Output**: Final Meta ad creative (composite image)

## Implementation Tasks

### ✅ Project Setup
- [x] Create requirements.txt
- [x] Create scope.md
- [x] Create project directory structure

### ✅ Agent 1 (Prompt Generator)
- [x] Implement prompt generation with 4 guidelines:
  - [x] Target audience (generate from image, ask user if unclear)
  - [x] Problem statement (compelling problem statements)
  - [x] How users will feel (emotional impact)
  - [x] Price (extract from customer input)
- [x] Create tests for Agent 1
- [x] Test with sample inputs

### ✅ Agent 2 (Creative Generator)
- [x] Implement image + text overlay generation
- [x] Create tests for Agent 2
- [x] Test with sample inputs

### ✅ Main Application
- [x] Create main.py with human-in-the-loop workflow
- [x] Implement user interaction flow
- [x] Add error handling

### ✅ Examples and Documentation
- [x] Create sample inputs
- [x] Add usage examples
- [x] Create README with setup instructions

### ✅ Model Updates
- [x] Update to use Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model
- [x] Update requirements.txt with Google dependencies
- [x] Update all agents to use Google API
- [x] Update tests for Google model
- [x] Update environment variable requirements

## Current Status
- ✅ Complete agentic system implemented
- ✅ Both agents using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop workflow implemented
- ✅ Tests created for both agents
- ✅ Sample data and examples provided

## Next Steps
1. Set up Google API key in .env file
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run sample workflow: `python examples/run_sample.py`
4. Test individual agents with pytest
5. Ready for production use!
